    scientific_name: "Aloe Vera",
    sun_requirements: "Full Sun",
    description: "Aloe vera is an eye-catching perennial that displays lance-shape succulent leaves decorated with white spots and edged with small whitish teeth. The leaves are known for their gel-like sap often used to soothe burns and moisturize skin. Native to hot, dry regions of Africa, this herbaceous perennial prefers frost-free, sunny, well-drained sites where the night temperature never dips below 50 degrees F. Thankfully, adaptable aloe vera makes a great houseplant; use it on its own or let it add vertical interest to a container of vining houseplants, such as philodendron or ivy. Exceptionally easy to grow, aloe vera is a good choice for a new gardener.",

    description: "One of the few houseplants that will bloom in low light, African violets grow well in bright east- or north-facing windows. Avoid locations where they will receive direct sunlight in the afternoonâ€”too much sun can burn leaves and prevent the plants from blooming. Turn plants weekly to encourage even growth on all sides.",

    sun_requirements "Any",
    description: "Peperomias are one of the easiest houseplants to grow in your home. Hailing from areas like tropical cloud forests, where humidity is generally over 90%, peperomias prefer areas with 40 to 50% humidity, such as terrariums. Likewise, it is easy to grow peperomia in your bathroom because of the high humidity levels. However, most peperomias perform almost as well in less-moist areas of your house. Because these plants are used to growing on rotting trees and other wood, they are also accustomed to fairly dry and erratic growing conditions. This is why many peperomias are succulent in nature. When growing peperomias in containers, make sure to plant them in well-drained soils. A quick way to kill peperomias is with too much water or too heavy of soil. They also have very few roots, so peperomias generally do best when grown in small containers.",

    sun_requirements: "Any",
    description: "This plant is extremely drought-tolerant, but its Achilles' heel is too much water. Snake plant needs well-drained potting mix that doesn't hold a lot of water. Ideally, snake plant likes to be in bright but indirect sunlight. However, you can park it in a dark corner and it'll be just fine. In less light, the color in some Sansevieria varieties can become washed out, and taller types can become leggy and floppy, but generally this isn't usually much of a problem.",

    description: "A spider plant likes bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight as it has the potential to scorch the leaves. If bright indirect light isn't an option, spider plants will grow in low light but they will grow slowly and may not produce plantlets. Spider plants grow well when their soil dries between watering. Check the soil every 4 or 5 days. If it is dry to the touch, water plants thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain out of the bottom of the pot.",
